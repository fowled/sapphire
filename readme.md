## Intro
Have you ever wondered how do your friends get such a clean status below their Discord profile?

Well - search no more. You've just found the solution!

## Prerequisites
- You need to have NodeJS v16.6.0 or newer installed on your machine.
- Create a Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and copy the `application ID`.

## Installation
1. First, start by cloning the repo.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fowled/sapphire.git
```

2. Then, install the `dependencies`.
```
$ npm install
```

3. Run the script and follow the CLI instructions!
```
$ npm start
```

## CLI instructions
- When running for the first time, the script will ask you a number of parameters to configure your rich embed status. Specify each one carefully.
- For the first field, you can find your application ID [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (select the app, then click `copy application id`).
- You may also note that the **[playing (game)]** is taken from your application name.
